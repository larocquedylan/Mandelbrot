// how to access each individual pixel of the canvas
// [R,G,B,A, _, _, _, _, _ .... npixel*4] i.e. 1 pixel takes 4 spots of the array our picture is 556*4 = 2224 W, 755*4 = 3020

// the sequence of pixels counts from (x,y)=(0,0) and works to the right. If our screen is 1280 px wide, then the pixel number of (0,1) would be 1281
// so if the (x,y) cordinates on the screen/canvas is (2,6) the number pixel would be {x + y _ width} = {2+6 _ 1280} = 10240
// so the way to find the number value for a given pixel are is by multiplying that whole thing by 4, cos remember r,g,b,a.

// to test this, we could load the pixels
//loadPixels();
// pixels [0] = 255
// pixels [1] = 255
// pixels [2] = 255
// pixels [3] = 255
// updatePixels();
// This would render the first pixels on the canvas as white
// You can use this to chnage every pixel!

// how to do it more efficiently? use a for loop that goes through every x, and then make another nested for loop that goes through every y for every x
